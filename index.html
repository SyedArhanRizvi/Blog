        <div class="content">ï»¿The 20th of Safar is known as the Day of Arbaeen,<br> as it marks the 40th day after the martyrdom of Imam Husayn,<br> alayhi as-salam, in Karbala.<br><br> Since the fall of Saddam Hussein in Iraq in 2003,<br> the world has been witnessing millions of pilgrims<br> who annually travel to Iraq to mark Arbaeen by walking<br> from Najaf to Karbala over a couple of days.<br> Some may be wondering what exactly is Arbaeen and<br> what is its religious significance?<br><br>

            The origin of the Arbaeen visitation of Imam Husayn,<br> alayhi as-salam, can be traced back to 61 Hijri, when<br> the companion of the Prophet Jabir ibn Abdilahl Ansari<br> arrived in Karbala on the 20th of Safar and saw the graves<br> of Imam al-Husayn and his companions on the plains of Karbala.<br><br>
            
            It has also been reported in some works of history<br> that the caravan of Imam Husayn, alayhi as-salam,<br> that had been imprisoned by Yazid in Damascus<br> were on their way back to Madinah after being released.<br> During their return, they also arrived in Karbala<br> on the 20th of Safar and encountered Jabir. After the<br> caravan informed Jabir of the details of the tragedy that<br> transpired in Karbala on the day of Ashura, they all began<br> to recite, eulogies and mourn the martyrs.<br><br>
            
            One of the most famous traditions for Arbaeen is the report<br> attributed to Imam Al-Askari alayhi as-salam, in which he says<br> "the signs of a believer are 5, 51 units of prayers, Ziarat al-Arbaeen,<br> wearing the ring on the right hand, prostrating one's forehead on the<br> ground, and reciting Bismillah Al-Rahman Al-Rahim, loudly in prayers".<br><br>
            
            Further, in a narration from Imam al-Sadiq, alayhi as-salam,<br> he tells one of his companions to visit and send salutations to<br> Imam Husayn, alayhi as-salam, on the 40th day of his martyrdom,<br> indicating the highly recommended nature of visiting the Imam<br> on this specific day. This establishes that visiting Imam al-Husayn,<br> alayhi as-salam, on this day is not an innovation, rather,<br> it is from the teachings of the Prophet, salla Allahu alayhi wa alihi<br> wa sallam, and the inheritors of his knowledge, the Imams of the<br> Ahl ul-Bayt, alayhi as-salam.<br><br>
            
            According to some narrations, walking to the Ziyarah<br> of Imam al-Husayn, alayhi as-salam, is itself relevant<br> and has lots of rewards. In one narration, Imam al-Sadiq,<br> alayhi as-salam, says: "Whoever comes to the grave of<br> Husayn while walking, Allah writes a thousand good deeds<br> for him in every step, erases a thousand sins, and raises him<br> a thousand levels".<br><br>
            
            During the brutal rule of Saddam Hussein, restrictions were<br> placed on this walk, but since his fall, Iraq saw an organic<br> revival of the walk, that was being suppressed for many decades.<br> In fact, today it attracts millions of people, not just from within<br> Iraq but all over the world.<br><br>

            <div class="cont2"><p>Today, the Arbaeen walk has turned into one of the symbols of<br> Islamic identity and a cause for propagating the message of Islam<br> and therefore should be venerated as one of the symbols of Allah.<br><br></div>
